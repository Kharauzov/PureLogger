## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'PureLogger'
```

### Manually

Just copy **Source** folder to your Xcode project.

## How To

**Method #1 - Globally**

After adding the framework to your project, you need to import the module in your AppDelegate class.
```swift
import PureLogger
```
Then add this line just below
```swift
let log = Log.shared
```
After this you can access ```log``` istance across all project.
```swift
log.debug("Testing debug log")
```

**Method #2 - Locally**

After adding the framework to your project, you need to import the module in the every class, you wish to use the logger.
```swift
import PureLogger
```
Then you need to initialise the local logger like this
```swift
let log = Log()
```
After this you can access ```log``` istance in the appropriate class.

**Available methods**
```swift
log.debug(...)
log.info(...)
log.warning(...)
log.error(...)
```

Also you can use such logic, if you want to print only input item itself without any additional information.
```swift
Log("Simple log")
```

Besides this, you can customize emoji, date format and other things at the output information to fit your demands ðŸ˜‰
